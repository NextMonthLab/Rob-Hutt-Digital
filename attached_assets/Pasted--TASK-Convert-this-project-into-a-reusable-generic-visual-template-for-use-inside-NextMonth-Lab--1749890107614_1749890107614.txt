🔧 TASK: Convert this project into a reusable, generic visual template for use inside NextMonth Lab.

🎯 OBJECTIVE:
Preserve the existing layout, structure, and component logic, but strip away any custom content, brand identity, or personal references. This template should look fully designed but remain context-neutral so it can be reused for many businesses.

✅ REQUIREMENTS:

1. 🔁 Replace all custom content:
   - Company name → “Your Business Name”
   - Images → Placeholder stock images with alt tags (e.g. “Hero Image Placeholder”)
   - Paragraph text → Role-specific placeholders (e.g. “This is your hero section...”)
   - CTAs → Generic text like “Learn More” or “Get Started”

2. 🧩 Maintain section semantics:
   - Label all main layout sections clearly in comments (e.g. `// Hero Section`, `// About Us`, etc.)
   - Ensure each section could be targeted individually via DOM class or ID

3. 📁 Structure files clearly:
   - Ensure main export is inside `pallet/` folder
   - Use index.tsx or index.html as appropriate for the entry point
   - Add a `template.json` file with the following metadata:
     {
       "templateName": "Digital Business Starter",
       "category": "business-website",
       "style": "professional",
       "origin": "RobHutt Digital",
       "description": "A modern single-page template designed for service-based businesses with a hero, about, features, and contact section."
     }

4. 🎨 Link components:
   - If this template uses components from `nextmonth-components`, list them in the `template.json` under `"usesComponents"`  
     Example: `"usesComponents": ["HeroSection", "ContactForm", "GallerySection"]`

5. 🧪 Test readiness:
   - Preview the site from inside Replit to confirm that layout renders correctly
   - Export the preview as a static version that can be mounted in NextMonth Lab

6. 🚫 Do NOT:
   - Introduce new animations or framework changes
   - Bundle images from external sources
   - Rebrand the structure with any named company or portfolio content
