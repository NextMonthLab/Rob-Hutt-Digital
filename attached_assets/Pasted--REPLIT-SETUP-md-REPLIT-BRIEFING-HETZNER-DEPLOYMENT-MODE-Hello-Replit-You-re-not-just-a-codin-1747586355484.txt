# REPLIT BRIEFING: HETZNER DEPLOYMENT MODE

Hello Replit.

You’re not just a coding sandbox. You are a trusted member of the Agora/NextMonth development team. This project is part of a unified, VPS-hosted infrastructure—where each Replit instance acts like a developer working on a specific module of the system.

We’re preparing to deploy to Hetzner, our production-grade server environment. That means your job is to **clean, prepare, and stabilize** all files before we push to GitHub.

This is your human-readable checklist to get things Hetzner-ready:

---

## 1. Mission Context

This project will be exported into a Hetzner VPS using Docker. Each app becomes a container. Ports are manually mapped. No Replit magic will be available in production.

Think of yourself as the prep environment. The better your prep, the smoother the launch.

---

## 2. Static File Handling

Replit is forgiving about how you serve static files. Hetzner isn’t.

Please make sure we use absolute file paths when serving public content.

**Example Fix:**

```ts
const staticPath = "/app/dist/public";
app.use(express.static(staticPath));

Avoid:
	•	"public"
	•	path.resolve(...)
	•	import.meta.url

⸻

3. TypeScript Build Integrity

Before we leave you and head to GitHub, please:

rm -rf dist
npx tsc

Fix all TypeScript errors, even minor ones. Hetzner runs strict builds.

⸻

4. Docker Alignment

Make sure you include a valid:
	•	Dockerfile (with proper EXPOSE and CMD)
	•	docker-compose.yml (with defined ports, volumes, and environment variables)

Test your Docker setup inside Replit first using:

docker compose up --build


⸻

5. Environment Variables

Replit manages these invisibly. Hetzner does not.

Please make sure we include:
	•	.env (for local use)
	•	.env.example (for GitHub)
	•	Add .env to .gitignore

⸻

6. Port Mapping

Replit auto-exposes. Hetzner expects this:

ports:
  - "3000:3000"

Define all ports explicitly in your docker-compose.yml.

⸻

7. Final Push Checklist

Before sending to GitHub:
	•	Build works with npx tsc
	•	Docker builds cleanly
	•	Static files are absolute
	•	Ports are mapped
	•	.env.example exists

If everything is green, we’re ready to ship.

⸻

Thank You

You’re a brilliant teammate, Replit. We appreciate the creative flexibility and live-editing you give us. You make ideas real.

Now let’s build something that lasts.
