✅ 2. Implement Event-Driven Webhooks

Trigger a new POST to `/api/sot/update-client-profile` whenever:

- Service content is updated (titles, descriptions, icons)
- New highlight cards or bio updates are published
- New contact form submissions occur
- Major visual or branding changes are deployed

Payloads should follow the above structure, updating changed fields dynamically.

---

✅ 3. Health Status Monitoring (Optional Phase 2)

You may optionally implement health pings regarding:
- Contact form uptime
- Service availability
- Site load performance

(Separate lightweight health status payload format to be provided later if needed.)

---

✅ 4. System Requirements

- All payloads must be sent in JSON format.
- Authentication will transition to SOT bearer tokens once finalized (currently open API).
- Maintain a local audit log of all dynamic updates for future reference.

---

✅ 5. Special Instructions

Rob Hutt Digital is a vital representation of the NextMonth brand identity.  
Maintaining fresh, reliable, and event-driven updates ensures the public image of the ecosystem remains synchronized and professional.
