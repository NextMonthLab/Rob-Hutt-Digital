✅ Prompt for Replit: Personal Brand Digital Marketing Web App for Rob Hutt (Powered by NextMonth)

Project Name:
rob-hutt-digital

Purpose:
Create a modular personal brand web app for Rob Hutt that acts as a professional gateway and project builder within the NextMonth Dev ecosystem. This app showcases Rob’s expertise in digital strategy, automation, creative direction, and studio delivery—while also serving as an active testbed for CPT-based tool development inside NextMonth.

The site should integrate with the NextMonth Dev environment using Custom Post Types (CPTs, referred to as “Packages”) to define and populate reusable tools and workflows.

🧱 Page Structure & CPT Integration

Each screen should be a NextMonth Dev Screen with corresponding CPT setup (type: package) and allow for future automation mapping.

⸻

Each service should be structured as a CPT (package) with:

Initial services to include:
	•	📡 Studio Build & Delivery
